I"Ï<p>I have recently become an avid podcast collector over the past month or so and Iâ€™m clearly enjoying it. Long before downloading podcasts was even considered normal consumption of internet bandwidth, many of my mates were onto downloading a ton of them, daily. I remember just how odd that struck me and I couldnâ€™t figure their line of thinking whether they thought the internet would be shut down one day and theyâ€™d regret missed opportunities or they were seriously putting them to good use. To this day, iâ€™m more clueless than I was then, having downloaded a few now, I can tell you, consuming them is the hardest part.

What I have grown to love about podcasts, is the convenience they offer and the large pool of more expert advise that I can keep drumming into my head whether iâ€™m at work, eating or going somewhere. Iâ€™m in the process of switching domains from web development to tech entrepreneurship so I have been on the prowl for good stuff to listen to. I greatly recommend the following podcasts that I have taken a great addiction to:</p>

<p>Â <strong>1) Stanfordâ€™s Entrepreneurial Podcast</strong>Â (<a href="http://legend.co.zw/ecorner.stanford.edu">ecorner.stanford.edu</a>)</p>

<p>This is a great listen and a must have for anyone looking to grow what they know about starting and managing a startup. It features successful entrepreneurs from diverse fields, most of whom learnt at Stanford. Every show is filled with great anecdotes, Iâ€™d recommend you give it a go!</p>

<p><em>My favourite episode: From Stanford to Startup â€“ Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger (Instagram)</em></p>

<p><strong>2) Startups For the rest of us</strong>Â (<a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/">www.startupsfortherestofus.com</a>)</p>

<p>Done by Rob Walling and Mike Tabber, this is one of the most focused podcasts I have listened to. The presenters offer no-frills advice based on their own experiences in the startup world. Each show opens with them going through what they achieved in the last week before they dissect a major topic then sometimes they answer questions from budding entrepreneurs. It took a bit of time to warm to, but now I absolutely love it and I can assure you, itâ€™s a great find.</p>

<p><em>Important Takeaway: Knowing how other entrepreneurs are fighting their battles right now, will equip you with the latest armour and prevent you from giving up in tough times.</em></p>

<p><strong>3) This Week In Tech</strong>Â (<a href="http://legend.co.zw/twit.tc/twit">www.twit.tv/twit</a>)</p>

<p>This is a weekly podcast that discusses the most current news happening in technology. Hosted by Leo Laporte, each week features other great pundits from John C Dvorak to Robert Scoble. If youâ€™re in tech, you need to know whatâ€™s happening in tech. Subscribe to this one, and hear from the big guys.</p>

<p><strong>4) This Week In Startups</strong>Â (<a href="http://www.thisweekinstartups.com/">www.thisweekinstartups.com</a>)</p>

<p>This is sometimes a bi-weekly podcast and focuses a lot on startup news, pitches and events. From time to time it features respected entrepreneurs. Itâ€™s a great podcast, but the host sometimes talks a lot more than the guests, which might be a bit of a turnoff for some. Heâ€™s hilarious though so itâ€™s also easy to like him.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t bet on it for raw startup advice but itâ€™ll keep you updated on whatâ€™s happening.</p>

<p>If there are any other podcasts that you think fits the bill, go ahead and drop a comment!</p>
