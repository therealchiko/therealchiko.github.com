I"¼<p>In his famous Stanford commencement address, Steve Jobs said something about connecting the dots and how you can only do that after the fact. The first time I heard that, it didnâ€™t shake my thinking; actually I dismissed it offhandedly without putting much thought into it. Not that I didnâ€™t think it wasnâ€™t true nor profound but like most things in life, hands-on experience is often more hard hitting than simple, verbal advice.</p>
