I"D<p>I have always been interested in Devops, tinkering with servers, writing some bash scripts and always grabbed the chance to get my hands dirty in server side stuff. Despite my interest, I hadn’t bothered to dig deeper into cloud computing to get a full picture of how everything merges together so it was something that was always at the back of my mind. In the course of building a side project, I decided to give serverless architecture a real go and discovered I wasn’t knowledgeable to a level of comfort which is when I was hit by the idea to get a deeper understanding into AWS services. After finishing the course, I am so glad I took it and will share my learnings in various blog posts as I document the making of my new sideproject, nroute. (more on that in future posts). For now let’s discuss how I planned and passed it.</p>

<h2 id="step-one-have-a-goal">Step One: Have a goal</h2>

<p>This is general advice, without a goal you won’t move as much as you can with one. When I decided to write my certification, I started off by paying for the exam fee, which effectively means I chose a date and made a solid commitment. In my case, I decided to give myself one month to study.</p>

<h2 id="step-two-have-a-plan-and-solid-habits">Step Two: Have a plan and solid habits</h2>

<p>With my date set for the exam, I Googled to find out best ways to go for the exam. I came across Stephane Maarek’s course on Udemy and liked the reviews on there I immediately snatched it to use as my main study material. Having a full time job, well as a contractor I work a full day, this meant I had to find time to study everyday either before everyone is up, or late at night. My goal initially was to study for 2 hours a day or finish one chapter a day. The course has about 30 chapters so my wish was to cover as much ground as possible on weekends (2 or 3 chapters) to then create some time for mock exams towards day 20. This plan was too ambitious and I failed miserably. Doing this course is much more than just memorizing, that approach can work but I prefer to understand material so my method of blazing through content came at odds with my natural way of learning.</p>

<h2 id="step-three-be-flexible-make-adjustments">Step Three: Be flexible, make adjustments</h2>

<p>Around day 18 or so, I could tell there was no way I was going to be ready for the exam at day 30. At that point I was experimenting with smart notes and planning my days using Roam research. The beauty of Roam Research is it allows you to have interlinked ideas and see a lot of connections in your notes and writing, I decided to pivot all my study material to use it. Instead of capturing notes in Udemy, I decided to transfer them to Roam Research! This worked a treat and within about a week, I could tell how some of the services and patterns are linked to others - the aws architectural map started forming itself, I was ecstatic!</p>

<p>Due to covid and work piling up on the side, I decided to cancel my exam indefinitely until I was ready. Mistake number one. I never got ready for the exams for the next 3 or 4 months and just basically got distracted by more urgent needs.</p>

<h2 id="step-four-make-more-adjustments-and-dont-give-up">Step Four: Make more adjustments and don’t give up</h2>

<p>With the festive holiday looming, I decided to give it yet another go as I could see myself with a few days to rest after Christmas. This time around again I started by purchasing an exam ticket for the 31st of January 2021. I decided I’d need about a month again to get over the line if i could commit myself fully. I pressed pause on any other side projects, brushed up on my notes and in addition to the Udemy course, I did more research to find out how best to prepare for the exam. After trying out some exam dumps, I decided they were no good and purchased revision material on <a href="tutorials dojo">tutorialsdojo.com</a>. This was an absolute game changer.</p>

<h2 id="step-five-dive-in-head-first">Step Five: Dive in, head first</h2>

<p>After going through my Udemy course I decided to take mock exams on Tutorials Dojo and I gave myself one week to for “free learning” which included reading whitepapers and doing any labs just to make some concepts stick. On Tutorials Dojo I started scoring very low: 
51.85% (in my first attempt) but I stuck at it until I was consistently scoring in the 80s and 90s. What makes Tutorial Dojo so fantastic are the different ways of studying it offers, from timed tests, review mode to section based material, I was able to spot my weakness and zone in on them.</p>

<h2 id="pass">Pass</h2>

<p>When end of January came through, I did not feel prepared as such but I was ready. Doing anything in Africa is more complicated than it needs to be, we had a power outage for 26 hours and I didn’t get to properly revise the night before with my exam scheduled at 6am! Nevertheless, I went in determined to put my best foot forward and I was so happy to see the screen flash with “passed” at the end!</p>

<p>I wish you all the best in your journey, if you need any help regarding this exam just reach out anytime.</p>
