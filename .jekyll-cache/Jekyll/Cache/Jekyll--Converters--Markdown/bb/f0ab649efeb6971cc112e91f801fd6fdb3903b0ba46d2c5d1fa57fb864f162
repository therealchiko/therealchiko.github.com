I"µ<p>Last year was a busy and also difficult year for most people. I hadnâ€™t realized how hard it hit me until someone pointed out that I had written just one blog post the whole year! Of couse with Covid and major shifts in how people could socialize and work together, everything was so unpredictable. The one thing that I was still very happy about though was the work I was doing over at <a href="https://jasure.com">JaSure</a>. Since the beginning, we had been a remote company so we didnâ€™t suffer in terms of culture when work moved to Zoom and peopleâ€™s homes. Actually, I have worked remotely for close to 5/6 years now so itâ€™s fair to say remote is ALL I know at this point.</p>
