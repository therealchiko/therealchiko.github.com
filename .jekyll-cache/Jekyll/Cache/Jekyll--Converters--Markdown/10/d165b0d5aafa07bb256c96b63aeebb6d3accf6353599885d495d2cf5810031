I"<p>I love boxing. Well, it’s one of the <em>many</em> sports I watch but my passion for it probably exceeds my passion for all other sports combined. As a result, I sift through a lot of tape of boxers practicing for big matches; I love the mental game and I smile warmly when the hard grit and pushing of physical boundaries is rewarded at the end of a tense encounter. A recent memory that springs to mind was the match between Jarret “Swift” Hurd and Julian Williams. Let’s talk about that for a second:</p>

<p>A couple of months before this bout, Swift was looking like a solid champion. He’s a guy that does get touched though, his defense is not the best in the game but he was a champion who had defended his belt and went into the fight as the defending champ. Williams on the other hand had lost dismally to Jermell Charlo by being brutally knocked out. Everything seemed to be pointing to a Hurd victory (he broke into song at one of the pre-fight press conferences). Willams, the underdog, physcially dominated and dropped Hurd on his way to a clear, unanimous victory. After the match, it became clear how much work Williams had put in to win that fight. This quote after the match says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They told me I was done, that I had no chin,” Williams said. “Jarrett’s such a great fighter and he pushed me. I got so motivated because everybody was doubting me. I turned my Twitter off, I turned my Instagram off. I blocked out all the good stuff, I blocked out all the bad stuff. The boxing world, they make it seem like fighters take a loss and they can’t come back, and I just knew that wasn’t the case. Stop condemning fighters after they take a loss.”</p>
