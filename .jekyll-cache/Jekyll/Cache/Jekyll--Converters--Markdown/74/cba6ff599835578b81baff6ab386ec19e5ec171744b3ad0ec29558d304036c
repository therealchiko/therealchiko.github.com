I"Ù<p>Lesson learnt: FIGHT YOUR FEARS! So yesterday I got home after a weekend at my sisterâ€™s only to realize I didnâ€™t have the keys to the apartment. I HAD to get inside the flat though, I had a meeting scheduled for 12 noon. The only way was to get into the flat through a small little window, at the top there (see attached pic) Seemed like the most daring operation, lol growing up I hadnâ€™t climbed houses like my peers would possibly confess they so often did.</p>
