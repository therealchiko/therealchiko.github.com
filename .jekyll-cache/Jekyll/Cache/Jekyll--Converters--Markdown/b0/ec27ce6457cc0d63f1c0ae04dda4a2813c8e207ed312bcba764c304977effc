<p>21 Nov 2021</p>

<p>My workspace has certainly evolved so much over the years, from the time when I used a broken laptop we called “a refrigerator” (well, if the power cord moved, it would switch off lol) to now when my desk beeps for me to stand.  My decision process when picking equipment is pretty straightforward, I identify a weakness, then I research on the best fixes, try them out until I’m happy. so whilst it’s listed here - I would advise you to assess if it’s for <strong>your</strong> purpose, so this is in no way a list of recommendations. Without further ado, here is the list of tools I love and hate but use daily when working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Smart Power Trolly Inverter <a href="https://www.takealot.com/smart-power-trolley-1-5kva-1000w-pure-sine-inverter-ups-charger-/PLID41356450">Link</a>
It’s not a proper setup in Africa if it doesn’t account for backup power is it? Well, to counter the unpredictable loadshedding, I gritted my teeth and finally got an inverter that provides uninterrupted power until Eskom (main power supplier in South Africa) sorts out its issues. I fit in two <a href="https://www.takealot.com/lifepo4-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-100ah/PLID72176907">12V 100Ah Lithim Ion batteries</a> and given it produces 1000W pure sine wave output, it’s able to power all my devices. It’s a worthy investment and probably my favourite on this list. Rating: 4.5/5
  </li>
  <li>
    Keychron K1 V4 [Link](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-key
I have had this keyboard for about a year now and I <em>kinda</em> love it. I got it with brown switches so it’s pretty clicky, probably a bit too much for my liking but for my first mechanical keyboard it eased me into the “art” nice and gently! I still however think that I type faster on my Macbook Pro but I love the feedback this keyboard gives me. One challenge I encountered is where to place my palms so I paired it up with a block of wood for a palm rest and the combos works well enough. Rating: 3.5/5
  </li>
  <li>
    Logitech Master MX 3 Mouse
I love this mouse! It’s an absolute beast and it’s touted as one of the most productive mice one can have, I can testify to that. It’s super senstitive, and very configurable (per application). Before getting this I used a Magic mouse from Apple and there’s a big difference between the two, at least for me. I’d rate this a solid 4/5.
  </li>
  <li>
    Asus Proart display 27 inch <a href="https://www.asus.com/za/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/ProArt/ProArt-Display-PA278QV/">Link</a> and 24 inch <a href="https://www.takealot.com/asus-proart-pa248qv-24-wuxga-professional-monitor/PLID71035195">Link</a>
These displays are phenomenal! I got the 24 inch at the time when I was suffering from massive screen glare from a LG widescreen I was using. At first I wasn’t super excited about the downgrade from a 33” to a mere 24” but the resolution on these displays is amazing. With the ability to tilt them too, I started off with the 24 inch set up vertically but over time I have them sitting side by side and it’s a set up that works tremendously well. Rating: 4/5
  </li>
  <li>
    TekDesk Standing Desk <a href="https://www.deskstand.com/collections/featured-deskstands/products/tekdesk-electric-adjustable-height-standing-desk">Link</a>
I don’t think I can say a lot about this desk except for that it’s functional. One of the big advantages is the ability to work whilst standing of course, it works when I’m a little short of energy, you know those meetings late in the day when you’d rather not dose off. Yes, it’s meant to fight those off and keep you on your toes, literally. Rating: 3.5/5
  </li>
  <li>
    Elgato Key Light <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light">Link</a>
I have mixed feelings about this light. Whilst it works like a light should, it’s not very responsive when controlling it from its app. After the initial struggles of connecting it via Wifi each time you want to control it, it’s however easy to adjust and comes with a 2800-lumen output and a temperature range of up to 7000K which is fine. 3.5/5 kind of performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sony MX3
Again, this is pretty functional. I can’t say anymore than that, it’s silently effective, so much that I haven’t put on any other headphones and felt like i’m missing out massively. Being no audiophile, what I always need are headphones that allow me to focus in Starbucks and in random cafes I go to on Fridays for a change of scenery. These headphones excel at that and when travelling on a plane, they’re in a league of their own. 4/5
  </li>
  <li>
    Sony a6400 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-a6400-Mirrorless-Camera/dp/B07MV3P7M8?th=1">Link</a>
What a camera! I’m glad I got this beast for video calls and recordings. Not only is it strong and feels sturdy, but it the default 16-50mm lens it comes with are absolutely fantastic. I, of course, didn’t know that when I purchased so I coupled it with the also incredible but limited <a href="https://www.ormsdirect.co.za/sigma-30mm-f-1-4-dc-dn-contemporary-lens-sony-e">Sigma</a>. I say limited because of it has a fixed range, which is not always the best given the distance between where I place the camera and where I sit when taking calls. Away from the desk, it can’t do no wrong in terms of potrait photos, the aperture really flatters the photographer here so I give it a solid 4/5 rating.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shure SM7B mic <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/microphones/sm7b">Link</a>
This is a legendary mic. The best in the business, probably. The only sad thing about it is you don’t get to hear yourself but from the feedback of people on calls, it’s marvelous. I couldn’t be happier in terms of mic choice and I hope to give it a solid run over the next couple of years. It’s built like a tank as well so this is easily a 4.5/5 investment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shure MVi Digital Audio Interface <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/accessories/mvi">Link</a>
This is a logical choice that I had to make quickly after reading reviews that it can handle the SM7B nicely. Being a noob at sound, and with the SM7B not being a condenser mic, I felt it would work and it does. It’s easy enough to use, but only takes one input which might come to bite me later should I decide to have an instrument to play but for the purpose of podcasting and getting audio to the computer, it’s checked all boxes. 3.8/5
  </li>
  <li>
    TS3-plus <a href="https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/">Link</a>
To bring all the equipment together, the displays, network cables, and anything else I need to plug into my laptop really I use the very dependable TS3-plus. It’s a mean beast and ensures I use just one cable from my laptop to it, the rest of the ports it provides in a very clean and hidden way. It does get hot after many hours of use but besides that, I like how it handles everything I throw at it.

<h3 id="-i-changed-jobs-again-"><a href="/2021/09/18/change/"> I changed jobs, again! </a></h3>

<p>18 Sep 2021</p>

<p>Last year was a busy and also difficult year for most people. I hadn’t realized how hard it hit me until someone pointed out that I had written just one blog post the whole year! Of couse with Covid and major shifts in how people could socialize and work together, everything was so unpredictable. The one thing that I was still very happy about though, was the work I was doing over at <a href="https://jasure.com">JaSure</a>. Since the beginning, we had been a remote company so we didn’t suffer in terms of culture when work moved to Zoom and people’s homes. Actually, I have worked remotely for close to 5/6 years now so it’s fair to say remote is ALL I know at this point.</p>

<h3 id="-how-i-passed-aws-developer-associate-certification-"><a href="/2021/02/01/how-i-passed-aws-developer-associate-certification/"> How I passed AWS Developer Associate certification </a></h3>

<p>01 Feb 2021</p>

<p>I have always been interested in Devops, tinkering with servers, writing some bash scripts and always grabbed the chance to get my hands dirty in server side stuff. Despite my interest, I hadn’t dug deeper into cloud computing to get a full picture of how everything comes together and that irked me. In the course of building a side project and giving serverless architecture a real go I discovered I wasn’t knowledgeable to a level of comfort so I decided to get a better understanding of AWS. After finishing the course, I am so glad I took it and will share my learnings in future blog posts as I document the making of my new sideproject, nroute (more on that later). For now let’s discuss how I planned and passed it.</p>

<h3 id="-seriousness-"><a href="/2019/12/26/seriousness/"> Seriousness </a></h3>

<p>26 Dec 2019</p>

<p>I am a huge Arsenal supporter. I started loving the club because they wore a shade of red I liked when I was young. As the years rolled by with Arsene Wenger as coach, I got to like his approach and method of putting the club’s values first, before victories. Arsenal was one of the clubs that could lose beautifully which would leave a conflict of emotions in supporters after a game, yes points would have been lost but you would also recall special, magical moments created on the field which would make you overlook the final result. Since Wenger left though, the club has been in a bit of a tailspin. Unai Emery who took over about 2 years ago failed to win the fans over because of an unattractive style of play and few victories which eventually culminated in his sacking. In his place, Mikel Arterta, a former captain was put at the the helm. While watching his first video as Arsenal coach the idea of this blog post came about. It was refreshing to hear how clear he was about what it takes for Arsenal to get back to greatness. One theme that I took away, is how serious he approaches his work and the level he requires of everyone who will contribute.</p>

<p>On belief:</p>

<blockquote>
  …I want to start working with them (the players), I want to start looking in their eyes…
</blockquote>

<p>On culture:</p>

<blockquote>
  …I know what a winning culture is and should look like, which is for me, the most important thing.

<h3 id="-leaving-awesome-onesheep-"><a href="/2019/07/20/leaving-awesome-onesheep/"> Leaving awesome OneSheep </a></h3>

<p>20 Jul 2019</p>

<p>This is a post that I didn’t foresee myself writing for the last 3 or 4 years. It is amazing how long but short that time has been. Every day was always so fresh and full of promise, all because of the wonderful folks I was working with. I remember it like yesterday when I got the offer to become a full time contractor at <a href="https://onesheep.org">OneSheep</a>. Having been a Drupal contractor 2 years prior, I jumped at the chance to work on some awesome (and very diverse projects) and what a whirlwind it’s been with so many great memories made!</p>

<h3 id="-ignore-changes-to-specific-git-files-"><a href="/2019/05/18/ignoring-files-from-git-commits/"> Ignore changes to specific git files </a></h3>

<p>18 May 2019</p>

<p>There are times when you are working on something that should not be committed even though it has changed. In this instance, it’s not wise to add the changed files to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maybe because the file(s) should always remain in the repo</li>
  <li>or suppose it’s a config file with your private key for a service you are using locally, not everyone on the team even uses it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the case, git has an easy way for this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git update-index</code>! Here is how it works:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git update-index <span class="nt">--assume-unchanged</span> <span class="o">[</span>path_to_file]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This simple rule will delist/hide all changes on that file in future commits. That means you are free to edit the file locally and the changes won’t be staged nor pushed upstream! Listing the file again is straightforward:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git update-index <span class="nt">--no-assume-unchanged</span> <span class="o">[</span>path_to_file]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whilst the commands are handy, they do not come with an easy way to untrack an entire folder, which is not-great. However, this can be easily done by a bash command that can list all files you want to “untrack” locally and transverse that list, updating each file’s entry in the git index.</p>

<p>Update-index is a command that does exactly what it describes, it tells git to update its index for the tracked file it is given. When we set that entry of the file in the index to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assume-unchanged</code> what that does is tell Git to simply ignore anything that happens to that file. This results in performance gains via unburdening Git from doing unnecessary indexing on files we no longer care about. However, keep in mind that should the file be changed upstream, when merging commits, Git will still ignore it locally so it does introduce an extra step to be aware of.</p>

<p>Lastly the commands are pretty long. An easy way I use to set them to something friendlier is by aliasing them in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitconfig</code> file as follows:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="o">]</span>
assume-unchanged <span class="o">=</span> update-index <span class="nt">--assume-unchanged</span>
assume-changed <span class="o">=</span> update-index <span class="nt">--no-assume-unchanged</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After this change, you can easily call: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git assume-unchanged [file]</code>!</p>

<p>As always thank you for reading, if you have tips or advice or other ways you handle this, please fire away in the comments below.</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but nod my head the entire length of the blog post written by Jeremy Wagner on <a href="https://jeremy.codes/blog/make-it-boring/">make it boring</a>. It’s not often that I find someone literally following my train of thought so succinctly, albeit from their own unique angle.

<p>28 Jan 2019</p>

<p>When was the last time you thought about how you should be learning? Like many, I realized I went through formal education immersed in different kinds of learning methods but remained oblivious to reasons for using them. This has always bothered me because I enjoy learning, a lot and quickening the speed of it whilst reaping all the benefits, is the ultimate goal. With that motive in mind, I decided to enroll in the free course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning to learn</a> by Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley on Coursera. This blog post will outline some of the insights I have found helpful.</p>

<h3 id="-2018-"><a href="/2019/01/13/2018/"> 2018 </a></h3>

<p>13 Jan 2019</p>

<p>As is custom, at the end or start of year I share my goals and progress as we close and open new chapters. I don’t think there’s an actual chapter closed or opened, it’s comforting to think about it that way but i think life is a continuos stream of … life events that ultimately define our entire existence, there is no break. None. Whatever it may look like, it is a continuation. It’s a mere formality then to state that the last year and all that took place had been a long time coming, whether we acknowledge it or not.</p>

<p>Comparing what my aims were at the end of 2017 and now, I cannot help but feel like I am no longer as open with some of my ideas, goals etc. The reasons behind that are not quite apparent to me, but going through last year’s post I even marvelled at how much I shared about my life and where I intended to go. I sure do hope to investigate my reasons for initially defaulting to scraping the surface with this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="-recent-takeaways-from-pairing-"><a href="/2017/08/06/further-takeways-from-pairing/"> Recent takeaways from pairing </a></h3>

<p>06 Aug 2017</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, my workmate paid a visit to Harare from his place in Cape Town for some pair programming, again (yay!). After having had a head start in coding a web app for a mobile application (built with Xamarin), the objective was to quickly knock it into shape and ship it out. I had chosen VueJS for the frontend (because it’s awesome), supported by an API in Laravel - to maintain consistency with the mobile app, we wanted everything to remain exactly the same. During the time of pairing, I learned even more lessons than the other times when I have paired with other programmers.</p>

<h3 id="-working-time-"><a href="/2017/04/04/working/"> Working time </a></h3>

<p>04 Apr 2017</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, actually since the start of the year, i’ve experienced the most turbulent of times in terms of my daily schedule. Really i wish I was Cerberus, or could teleport to Mars and have slightly longer days. I’ve been under massive, gargantuan pressure to code, exercise, plan, reply emails and continue being a human <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/if-you-want-to-get-rich-stop-being-a-fucking-joker">who’s not a joker</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-how-to-add-your-own-executable-scripts-to-bash-"><a href="/2017/02/13/how-to-add-your-own-executable-scripts-to-bash/"> How to add your own executable scripts to bash </a></h3>

<p>13 Feb 2017</p>

<p>I have been enjoying the book Effective Engineer by Edmond Lau. One of the great tricks of becoming more effective is to set workflows that make you do more, much faster. I have ended up setting a few scripts to automate a lot of bash commands such as ssh-ing, using git etcetera and in this short primer i’d love to show total newbies how to have your own executable scripts from any place on your system.</p>

<p>The first thing to note here is Mac OS has a few candidate files in your home folder that it indexes for commands to use in every bash window. On my system, I prefer to use ~/.bash_rc mainly because it is loaded up when a new instance of a terminal window is opened compared to ~/.bash_profile which is loaded up at login.</p>

<h3 id="-2016-review-and-whats-next-"><a href="/2017/01/07/2016-review-and-whats-next/"> 2016 review and what’s next </a></h3>

<p>07 Jan 2017</p>

<p>I almost always set goals for the year. In 2016 I had a bunch of goals and I think it’s fair to say I achieved about 50% of them, which has me beaming! I came to the comforting conclusion about two years ago that I’m in a marathon and my prophetic powers being what they’re (non-existant), estimating time is tough but I sure as hell have an idea about my direction. With that out of the way, here’s how my 2016 turned out to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started working with the incredible folks at <a href="http://www.onesheep.org">Onesheep.org</a>. This is arguably the best bunch of people i’ve come across!</li>
  <li>I participated in the C4K Hackathon and our team came an impressive second. Yay</li>
</ul>

<p>06 Nov 2016</p>

<p>Recently I had to help with maintenance of a server that I didn’t configure myself that had maxed out its storage (the horror!). Anyway, it took me some time to figure out it was using the handy and useful <a href="http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/">rdiff-backup</a> package to create and store backups automatically. Rdiff-backup’s mission is succinctly put as <em>an idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup</em></p>

<p>As it turns out, rdiff-backup does come with a handy tool to configure it to delete backups that are x-days old e.g 4 weeks:</p>

<p>17 Oct 2016</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure to travel for some pair programming with a senior developer in our team who lives in Cape Town. This being our first meeting, I was really excited to finally meet the guy we all joke is a bot (internal joke). During my time in Strand (quiet city in Cape Town), I learnt some things I’d like to share here. These things became more apparent <strong>after</strong> our sessions and I think they should be considered huge benefits of pairing with someone more senior.</p>

<h3 id="-connecting-dots-"><a href="/2014/09/28/connecting-dots/"> Connecting Dots </a></h3>

<p>28 Sep 2014</p>

<p>In his famous Stanford commencement address, Steve Jobs said something about connecting the dots and how you can only do that after the fact. The first time I heard that, it didn’t shake my thinking; actually I dismissed it offhandedly without putting much thought into it. Not that I didn’t think it wasn’t true nor profound but like most things in life, hands-on experience is often more hard hitting than simple, verbal advice.</p>

<p>Lesson learnt: FIGHT YOUR FEARS! So yesterday I got home after a weekend at my sister’s only to realize I didn’t have the keys to the apartment. I HAD to get inside the flat though, I had a meeting scheduled for 12 noon. The only way was to get into the flat through a small little window, at the top there (see attached pic) Seemed like the most daring operation, lol growing up I hadn’t climbed houses like my peers would possibly confess they so often did.</p>

<p>Consistency is one of the key things young and budding entrepreneurs are never told enough times is fundamental to long-term, enduring success. In a lot of success talk and teachings people tend to concentrate on qualities that CREATE success, such as a strong desire for something, networking, working hard or smarter, etcetera. Based on experience so far, I can confidently say there’s something very close to what’s sometimes called “Beginner’s luck”. The easy-going, free flow of positive events at the start. It’s quite endearing and a lot of aspirants, quite literally, lose it at this early stage. Why that free, easy flow is often classified as success possibly has a lot to do with small, achieavable goals people set at start.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to stop many of the habits I had taken up in the past two, three years. That meant a lot of coding, consuming <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">entreporn</a> and talking a lot about opportunities we should be exploiting. What triggered this was not that I was feeling burned out, unmotivated or discouraged but I decided to find out what it felt like to live in an inhibited world once again.</p>

<p>This little letter was written by my niece, Ruva when she was over for the holiday last year. She’s 7 years old and learns at <a href="http://www.phoenixschoolmalawi.com/">Phoenix Primary School</a> in Malawi. After bugging me to write something to her parents, I decided to let her write a letter I promised to post on my blog.</p>

<p>Copied below is what she had to say:</p>

<p>I have recently become an avid podcast collector over the past month or so and I’m clearly enjoying it. Long before downloading podcasts was even considered normal consumption of internet bandwidth, many of my mates were onto downloading a ton of them, daily. I remember just how odd that struck me and I couldn’t figure their line of thinking whether they thought the internet would be shut down one day and they’d regret missed opportunities or they were seriously putting them to good use. To this day, i’m more clueless than I was then, having downloaded a few now, I can tell you, consuming them is the hardest part.</p>

<p>It’s a few days after the two week <a href="http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/creative-entrepreneurship/culture-shift/">Culture Shift</a> ideation and hackathon hosted by the British Council, <a href="http://www.jumpstart.co.zw/">Jumpstart</a> and <a href="http://www.culturecode.co.uk/">Culture Code (UK)</a> and for most of us, we are still basking in the afterglow. It was a wonderful event hosted to help local artists mingle with the techies and try to hack together some real solutions to their problems.</p>

<p>Any talk of perfection is often linked to <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/">minimalism</a>.</p>

<p>Growing up and learning about design, I was advised to know when something is both nice and useful when “when there is nothing more to remove”. That became the mark of near-perfection to me. As a result I have tried to abide by this rule when going about design and writing. This decision has come to haunt me on several occasions with comments centering on the work appearing “bland”, not exciting, very quiet and such. So maybe sometimes I personally have taken it too far? A big possibility given i’m not much of a designer but minimalism doesn’t just stop at design.</p>

<p>It’s a new year(!) and we all know what to expect, bigger things! 2011 was nothing but brilliant and I am 100% sure 2012 will be just as fruitful!</p>
