I"Ÿ<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My name is Chiko Mukwenha and iâ€™m a freelance software developer. Iâ€™m a digital nomad and specialize in different flavours of Javascript (React, VueJS, React Native), PHP, Python, CodeIgniter, Laravel. I harbour a huge, insatiable appetite for Git and general bash scripting.</p>

<p>This is my personal blog where I share about things that I learn in programming, life and finding happiness. I welcome feedback and iâ€™m usually ready for a chat so feel free to hit me
up on <a href="http://twitter.com/therealchiko">Twitter</a> if you have a great idea to share, comments or a project that needs my involvement.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
