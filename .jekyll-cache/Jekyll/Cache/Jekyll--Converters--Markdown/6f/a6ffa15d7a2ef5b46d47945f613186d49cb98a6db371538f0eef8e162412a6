I"<p>A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure to travel for some pair programming with a senior developer in our team who lives in Cape Town. This being our first meeting, I was really excited to finally meet the guy we all joke is a bot (internal joke). During my time in Strand (quiet city in Cape Town), I learnt some things Iâ€™d like to share here. These things became more apparent <strong>after</strong> our sessions and I think they should be considered huge benefits of pairing with someone more senior.</p>
