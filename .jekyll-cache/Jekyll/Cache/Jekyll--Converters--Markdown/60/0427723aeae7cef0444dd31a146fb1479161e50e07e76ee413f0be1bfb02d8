I"<p>It’s a few days after the two week <a href="http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/creative-entrepreneurship/culture-shift/">Culture Shift</a> ideation and hackathon hosted by the British Council, <a href="http://www.jumpstart.co.zw/">Jumpstart</a> and <a href="http://www.culturecode.co.uk/">Culture Code (UK)</a> and for most of us, we are still basking in the afterglow. It was a wonderful event hosted to help local artists mingle with the techies and try to hack together some real solutions to their problems.</p>
