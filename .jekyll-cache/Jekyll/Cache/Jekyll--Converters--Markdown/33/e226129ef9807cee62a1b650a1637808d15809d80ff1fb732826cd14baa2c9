I"!<p>I love boxing. Well, it’s one of the <em>many</em> sports I watch but my passion for it probably exceeds my passion for all other sports combined. As a result, I sift through a lot of tape of boxers practicing for big matches; I love the mental game and I smile warmly when the hard grit and pushing of physical boundaries is rewarded at the end of a tense encounter. Before we go deeper into boxing and some of the things I wish to share, let’s talk about soccer, my other passion briefly.</p>

<h2 id="on-being-serious">On being serious</h2>

<p>I am a huge Arsenal supporter. I started loving the club because they wore a shade of red I liked when I was young and over the years when they had Arsene Wenger as coach, I got to like his approach and method of putting the club’s values first, before victories. After Wenger left, the club has been in a bit of a tailspin. Unai Emery who took over right after Wenger about 2 years ago failed to win the scoreboards and fans over which culminated in his sacking a few weeks ago. In his place, Mikel Arterta, a former captain was put at the the helm. While watching his first video as Arsenal coach the idea of this blog post came about. It was refreshing to hear how clear he was about what it takes for Arsenal to get back to greatness. One theme that I took away, was just about how serious he approached his work and the level he required of everyone who will contribute.</p>

<p>On belief:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…I want to start working with them (the players), I want to start looking in their eyes…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On culture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…I know what a winning culture is and should look like, which is for me, the most imporant thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will not convince the players I have experience, I will convince them that I know certain things that if we do, will bring success and those are non-negotiables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On being real:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to be me , I do not want to be anyone else, it has to be natural, it has to come from inside and if that’s the case the player will trust me and i will be able to convince them what to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On culture, again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.. I think we have to create the right culture around the club where everyone respects each other, a humility and people have to be accountable for what we want to achieve. That’s the basics and then we can grow from there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On being able to understand and create a bond with players:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are like a heart surgeon, I need to understand the feelings, I need to scrach there and understand how they feel. If i am able to do that and they feel that they can trust me, I will understand the decisions and behaviours much better and then the communication will improve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the full interview:</p>

<p>Now let’s come back to boxing where this concept of being serious has grave consequences (on health and performance), whilst being easy to judge.</p>

<h3 id="swift-vs-williams">Swift Vs Williams</h3>

<p>A couple of months before this bout, Swift was looking like a solid champion. He’s a guy that does get touched though, his defense is not the best in the game but he was a champion who had defended his belt a few times and went into the fight the favourite. Williams on the other hand had lost dismally to Jermell Charlo by being brutally knocked out. Everything seemed to be pointing to a Hurd victory (he broke into song at one of the pre-fight press conferences). Willams, the underdog, physcially dominated and dropped Hurd on his way to a clear, unanimous victory. After the match, it became clear how much work Williams had put in to win that fight. This quote after the match says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They told me I was done, that I had no chin,” Williams said. “Jarrett’s such a great fighter and he pushed me. I got so motivated because everybody was doubting me. I turned my Twitter off, I turned my Instagram off. I blocked out all the good stuff, I blocked out all the bad stuff. The boxing world, they make it seem like fighters take a loss and they can’t come back, and I just knew that wasn’t the case. Stop condemning fighters after they take a loss.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="andy-ruiz-vs-joshua">Andy Ruiz Vs Joshua</h3>

<p>On the other hand, there was a shock victory when the defending heavyweight champion got what seemed like a routine cherrypick against the buffy Andy Ruiz. Going into the fight, Joshua was being touted as the next big thing in boxing, he had defeated a couple of decent contenders before big crowds in the UK where he comes from. When the time came to face a huge underdog after his mandatory challenger Jarrell Miller was busted for using PEDs, he thought it was going to be a normal night in the squared ring. What happened instead, was shocking. Andy Ruiz came into the fight without much of a period to psych up and train for Joshua. After being dropped to the canvas in the 3rd round, Andy got back up on his feet and delivered a battering to Joshua that shocked the world. In the 7th round he became the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world.</p>

<h4 id="the-rematch">The rematch</h4>

<p>Given the result of the fight, and the contract for it having a rematch clause, Joshua decided to activate that right away to earn his titles back. Whilst Joshua worked hard to change his style to deal with this new threat, Andy Ruiz was getting used to being champion of the world and having extra cents in his pocket. He went on a splurge that included house purchases and cars, soaking up as much of the spotlight as he could. The day the rematch happened, Andy Ruiz was in horrible shape, overweight and had missed the first few weeks of training. In contrast, Joshua who had had the belts for a good period of his professional career came in lighter and looked more focused albeit with low confidence. He swiftly took his belts back without much physical resistance from Andy Ruiz.</p>

<p>Let’s pause for a moment and think about this: Andy Ruiz had the whole world at attention after a shock win, with the rematch looming one would think he would put in the hard graft to make the biggest statement and remain champion, right. How could it be he came in in worse shape than the former champion?</p>

<h3 id="tony-harrison-vs-jermall-charlo">Tony Harrison Vs Jermall Charlo</h3>

<p>In another surprising match, in the middleweight class, the champion Jermall Charlo defended his belt against the little known Tony Harrison. Whilst Jermall is not really known for being heavy-handed, he fought to get a knockout during the fight but round by round it proved elusive. Tony Harrison fought a clever fight of boxing and avoiding long exchanges, however it was just not enough to be convincing. After the fight went to the scorecards (because there was no knockout), Tony Harrison was declared the victor by all the judges. Many in the boxing community were not impressed which warranted a rematch.</p>

<h4 id="the-rematch-1">The rematch</h4>

<p>During the build up to the rematch Jermall, feeling hard done by the judges the first time, wore his emotions on his sleeve with Harrison as cool as a cucumber; he just didn’t take anything said by the former champion seriously. Jermall had a hard time dealing with such a calm head and became emotional. After the first bell rang, the fight did not disappoint with Jermall dropping Harrison early in the second round. After getting up however, Harrison boxed intelligently once again and won a couple of rounds clearly which gave his confidence a major boost. He felt so in control that he started showboating during the middle rounds. On one such occassion in the 11th round, he was caught napping and knocked down out of nowhere! Upon getting up, he was hit with some solid shots again and had to cover up on the ropes which forced the referee to halt the context.</p>

<p>After the match, a tearful Harrison knew what chance he had let slip. In his own words, he relaxed because he felt his was “coasting”.</p>
