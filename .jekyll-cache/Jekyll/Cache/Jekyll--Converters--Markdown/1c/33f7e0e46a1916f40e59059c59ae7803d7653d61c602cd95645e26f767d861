I"ô<p>Consistency is one of the key things young and budding entrepreneurs are never told enough times is fundamental to long-term, enduring success. In a lot of success talk and teachings people tend to concentrate on qualities that CREATE success, such as a strong desire for something, networking, working hard or smarter, etcetera. Based on experience so far, I can confidently say thereâ€™s something very close to whatâ€™s sometimes called â€œBeginnerâ€™s luckâ€. The easy-going, free flow of positive events at the start. Itâ€™s quite endearing and a lot of aspirants, quite literally, lose it at this early stage. Why that free, easy flow is often classified as success possibly has a lot to do with small, achieavable goals people set at start.</p>
