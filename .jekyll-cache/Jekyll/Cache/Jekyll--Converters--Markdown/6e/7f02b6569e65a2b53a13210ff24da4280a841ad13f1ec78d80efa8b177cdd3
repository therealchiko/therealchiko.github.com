I"â<p>The purpose of this page is to help you with the most basic answers to questions you may have about webmail and web 
hosting service I offer.</p>

<p>Firstly, you belong in either of two categories: local or international client. International client is any business
or individual not-based in Zimbabwe.</p>

<h2 id="international-clients">International Clients</h2>

<p>If you are an international client, I advise you to write an email to hi@chikomukwenha.co
for quick and prompt assistance. It‚Äôs easier to provide help in a way that is timezone agnostic.</p>

<h2 id="local-clients">Local Clients</h2>

<p>If you are a local client, it‚Äôs very likely you are reading this to find out how to access your webmail. (just my assumption!)</p>

<p>To access your email, please follow these instructions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your webmail access is always available at: webmail.yourdomain.org</li>
  <li>Depending on the addresses created, there should always be an info@yourdomain.org registered.</li>
  <li>On your login page, ALWAYS enter your username in full: as opposed to entering info, enter ‚Äúinfo@yourdomain.org‚Äù</li>
  <li>Once you have entered your password, if you‚Äôre logging in for the first time, you‚Äôll likely be prompted to pick one
email client to use as default. I recommend Roundcube but the choice remains yours.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you face any challenges, please reach out to me anytime.</p>
