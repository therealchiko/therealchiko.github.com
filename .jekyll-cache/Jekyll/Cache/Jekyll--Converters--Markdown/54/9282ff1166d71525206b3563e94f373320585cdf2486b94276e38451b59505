I"Î<p>As is custom, at the end or start of year I share my goals and progress as we close and open new chapters. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s an actual chapter closed or opened, itâ€™s comforting to think about it that way but i think life is a continuos stream of â€¦ life events that ultimately define our entire existence, there is no break. None. Whatever it may look like, it is a continuation. Itâ€™s a mere formality then to state that the last year and all that took place had been a long time coming, whether we acknowledge it or not.</p>

<p>Comparing what my aims were at the end of 2017 and now, I cannot help but feel like I am no longer as open with some of my ideas, goals etc. The reasons behind that are not quite apparent to me, but going through last yearâ€™s post I even marvelled at how much I shared about my life and where I intended to go. I sure do hope to investigate my reasons for initially defaulting to scraping the surface with this blog post.</p>
