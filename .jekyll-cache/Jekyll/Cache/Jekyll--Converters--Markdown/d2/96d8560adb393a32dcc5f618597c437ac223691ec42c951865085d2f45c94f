I"¾<p>Any talk of perfection is often linked toÂ <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/">minimalism</a>.</p>

<p>Growing up and learning about design, I was advised to know when something is both nice and useful when â€œwhen there is nothing more to removeâ€. That became the mark of near-perfection to me. As a result I have tried to abide by this rule when going about design and writing. This decision has come to haunt me on several occasions with comments centering on the work appearing â€œblandâ€, not exciting, very quiet and such. So maybe sometimes I personally have taken it too far? A big possibility given iâ€™m not much of a designer but minimalism doesnâ€™t just stop at design.</p>
