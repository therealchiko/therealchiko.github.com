I"ƒ<p>I love boxing. Well, it‚Äôs one of the <em>many</em> sports I watch but my passion for it probably exceeds my passion for all other sports combined. As a result, I sift through a lot of tape of boxers practicing for big matches; I love the mental game and I smile warmly when the hard grit and pushing of physical boundaries is rewarded at the end of a tense encounter. A recent memory that springs to mind was the match between Jarret ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù Hurd and Julian Williams. Let‚Äôs talk about that for a second:</p>

<h3 id="swift-vs-williams">Swift Vs Williams</h3>

<p>A couple of months before this bout, Swift was looking like a solid champion. He‚Äôs a guy that does get touched though, his defense is not the best in the game but he was a champion who had defended his belt and went into the fight as the defending champ. Williams on the other hand had lost dismally to Jermell Charlo by being brutally knocked out. Everything seemed to be pointing to a Hurd victory (he broke into song at one of the pre-fight press conferences). Willams, the underdog, physcially dominated and dropped Hurd on his way to a clear, unanimous victory. After the match, it became clear how much work Williams had put in to win that fight. This quote after the match says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThey told me I was done, that I had no chin,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúJarrett‚Äôs such a great fighter and he pushed me. I got so motivated because everybody was doubting me. I turned my Twitter off, I turned my Instagram off. I blocked out all the good stuff, I blocked out all the bad stuff. The boxing world, they make it seem like fighters take a loss and they can‚Äôt come back, and I just knew that wasn‚Äôt the case. Stop condemning fighters after they take a loss.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="andy-ruiz-vs-joshua">Andy Ruiz Vs Joshua</h3>

<p>On the other hand, there was a shock victory when the defending champion got what seemed like a routine cherrypick against the buffy Andy Ruiz. Going into the fight, Joshua was being touted as the next big thing in boxing, he had defeated a couple of decent contenders before big crowds in the UK where he comes from. When the time came to face a huge underdog after his mandatory challenger Jarrell Miller was busted for using PEDs, he thought it was going to be a normal night in the squared ring. What happened instead, was shocking. Andy Ruiz came into the fight without much of a period to psych up and train for Joshua. After being dropped to the canvas in the 3rd round, Andy he got back up on his feet and delivered a battering to Joshua that shocked the world. In the 7th round he became the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world.</p>

<h3 id="tony-harrison-vs-jermall-charlo">Tony Harrison Vs Jermall Charlo</h3>

<p>In another surprising match, in the middleweight class, the champion Jermall Charlo defended his belt against the little known Tony Harrison. Whilst Jermall is not really known for being heavy-handed, he fought to get a knockout during the fight but round by round it proved elusive. Tony Harrison fought a clever fight that night of boxing and avoiding long exchanges, however it was not nearly enough to be convincing. After the fight went to the scorecards (because there was no knockout), Tony Harrison was declared the victor. Many in the boxing community were not impressed which warranted a rematch.</p>

<h2 id="on-being-serious">On being serious</h2>

<p>I also happen to be a huge Arsenal supporter. I loved the club based on the fact they wore a shade of red I liked when I was young and over the years when they had Arsene Wenger as coach, I really liked his approach and method of putting the club‚Äôs values first, before victories. After Wenger left, the club has been in a bit of a tailspin. Unai Emery who took over right after Wenger about 2 years ago failed to win the scoreboards and fans over which culminated in his sacking a few weeks ago. In his place, Mikel Arterta, a former captain was put at the the helm. It was while watching his first video as Arsenal coach that the idea of this blog post came about. It was refreshing to hear how clear he was about what it takes for Arsenal to get back to greatness. One theme that I took away, was just about how serious he approached his work and the level he required of everyone to be able to contribute.</p>

  <p>‚Ä¶I want to start working with them (the players), I want to start looking in their eyes‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶I know what a winning culture is and should look like, which is for me, the most imporant thing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will not convince the players I have experience, I will convince them that I know certain things that if we do, will bring success and those are non-negotiables.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to be, I do not want to be anyone else, it has to be natural, it has to come from inside and if that‚Äôs the case the player will trust me and i will be able to convince them what to do.</p>
