I"N<p>I have always been interested in Devops, tinkering with servers, writing some bash scripts and always grabbed the chance to get my hands dirty in server side stuff. Despite my interest, I hadn’t bothered to dig deeper into cloud computing to get a full picture of how everything merges together so it was something that irked me at the back of my mind. In the course of building a side project, I decided to give serverless architecture a real go and discovered I wasn’t knowledgeable to a level of comfort which is when I was hit by the idea to get a deeper understanding into AWS services. After finishing the course, I am so glad I took it and will share my learnings in various blog posts as I document the making of my new sideproject, nroute. (more on that in future posts). For now let’s discuss how I planned and passed it.</p>
