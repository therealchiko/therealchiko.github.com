I"∆<p>My workspace has certainly evolved so much over the years, from the time when I used a broken laptop we called ‚Äúa refrigerator‚Äù (well, if the power cord moved, it would switch off lol) to now when my motorized desk beeps for me to stand.  My decision process when picking equipment is pretty straightforward, I identify a weakness, research on the best fixes, and cross my fingers it will work. (Unfortunately, trying out equipment in Africa is pretty tough given limited supply and shipping constraints). Without further ado, here is the list of tools I love and use almost daily when working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Smart Power Trolly Inverter</strong> <a href="https://www.takealot.com/smart-power-trolley-1-5kva-1000w-pure-sine-inverter-ups-charger-/PLID41356450">Link</a>
It‚Äôs not a proper setup in Africa if it doesn‚Äôt account for backup power is it? Well, to counter the unpredictable loadshedding, I gritted my teeth and finally got an inverter that provides uninterrupted power until Eskom (main power supplier in South Africa) sorts out its issues. I fit in two <a href="https://www.takealot.com/lifepo4-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-100ah/PLID72176907">12V 100Ah Lithim Ion batteries</a> and given it produces 1000W pure sine wave output, it‚Äôs able to power all my devices. It‚Äôs a worthy investment and probably my favourite on this list. Rating: 4.5/5</p>

    <p><strong>Keychron K1 V4</strong> [Link](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-key
I have had this keyboard for about a year now and I <em>kinda</em> love it. I got it with brown switches so it‚Äôs pretty clicky, probably a bit too much for my liking but for my first mechanical keyboard it eased me into the ‚Äúart‚Äù nice and gently! I still however think that I type faster on my Macbook Pro but I love the feedback this keyboard gives me. One challenge I encountered is where to place my palms so I paired it up with a block of wood for a palm rest and the combos works well enough. Rating: 3.5/5</p>

    <p>Logitech Master MX 3 Mouse
I love this mouse! It‚Äôs an absolute beast and it‚Äôs touted as one of the most productive mice one can have, I can testify to that. It‚Äôs super senstitive, and very configurable (per application). Before getting this I used a Magic mouse from Apple and there‚Äôs a big difference between the two, at least for me. I‚Äôd rate this a solid 4/5.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Asus Proart display 27 inch <a href="https://www.asus.com/za/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/ProArt/ProArt-Display-PA278QV/">Link</a> and 24 inch <a href="https://www.takealot.com/asus-proart-pa248qv-24-wuxga-professional-monitor/PLID71035195">Link</a>
These displays are phenomenal! I got the 24 inch at the time when I was suffering from massive screen glare from a LG widescreen I was using. At first I wasn‚Äôt super excited about the downgrade from a 33‚Äù to a mere 24‚Äù but the resolution on these displays is amazing. With the ability to tilt them too, I started off with the 24 inch set up vertically but over time I have them sitting side by side and it‚Äôs a set up that works tremendously well. Rating: 4/5</p>

  <li>
    <p>TekDesk Standing Desk <a href="https://www.deskstand.com/collections/featured-deskstands/products/tekdesk-electric-adjustable-height-standing-desk">Link</a>
I don‚Äôt think I can say a lot about this desk except for that it‚Äôs functional. One of the big advantages is the ability to work whilst standing of course, it works when I‚Äôm a little short of energy, you know those meetings late in the day when you‚Äôd rather not dose off. Yes, it‚Äôs meant to fight those off and keep you on your toes, literally. Rating: 3.5/5</p>

    <p>Elgato Key Light <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light">Link</a>
I have mixed feelings about this light. Whilst it works like a light should, it‚Äôs not very responsive when controlling it from its app. After the initial struggles of connecting it via Wifi each time you want to control it, it‚Äôs however easy to adjust and comes with a 2800-lumen output and a temperature range of up to 7000K which is fine. 3.5/5 kind of performance.</p>

    <p>Sony MX3
Again, this is pretty functional. I can‚Äôt say anymore than that, it‚Äôs silently effective, so much that I haven‚Äôt put on any other headphones and felt like i‚Äôm missing out massively. Being no audiophile, what I always need are headphones that allow me to focus in Starbucks and in random cafes I go to on Fridays for a change of scenery. These headphones excel at that and when travelling on a plane, they‚Äôre in a league of their own. 4/5</p>

    <p>Sony a6400 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-a6400-Mirrorless-Camera/dp/B07MV3P7M8?th=1">Link</a>
What a camera! I‚Äôm glad I got this beast for video calls and recordings. Not only is it strong and feels sturdy, but it the default 16-50mm lens it comes with are absolutely fantastic. I, of course, didn‚Äôt know that when I purchased so I coupled it with the also incredible but limited <a href="https://www.ormsdirect.co.za/sigma-30mm-f-1-4-dc-dn-contemporary-lens-sony-e">Sigma</a>. I say limited because of it has a fixed range, which is not always the best given the distance between where I place the camera and where I sit when taking calls. Away from the desk, it can‚Äôt do no wrong in terms of potrait photos, the aperture really flatters the photographer here so I give it a solid 4/5 rating.</p>

    <p>Shure SM7B mic <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/microphones/sm7b">Link</a>
This is a legendary mic. The best in the business, probably. The only sad thing about it is you don‚Äôt get to hear yourself but from the feedback of people on calls, it‚Äôs marvelous. I couldn‚Äôt be happier in terms of mic choice and I hope to give it a solid run over the next couple of years. It‚Äôs built like a tank as well so this is easily a 4.5/5 investment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shure MVi Digital Audio Interface <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/accessories/mvi">Link</a>
This is a logical choice that I had to make quickly after reading reviews that it can handle the SM7B nicely. Being a noob at sound, and with the SM7B not being a condenser mic, I felt it would work and it does. It‚Äôs easy enough to use, but only takes one input which might come to bite me later should I decide to have an instrument to play but for the purpose of podcasting and getting audio to the computer, it‚Äôs checked all boxes. 3.8/5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TS3-plus <a href="https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/">Link</a>
To bring all the equipment together, the displays, network cables, and anything else I need to plug into my laptop really I use the very dependable TS3-plus. It‚Äôs a mean beast and ensures I use just one cable from my laptop to it, the rest of the ports it provides in a very clean and hidden way. It does get hot after many hours of use but besides that, I like how it handles everything I throw at it.</p>
