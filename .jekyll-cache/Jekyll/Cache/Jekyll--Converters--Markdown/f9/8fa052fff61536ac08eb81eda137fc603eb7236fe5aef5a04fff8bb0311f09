<h2 id="on-being-serious">On being serious</h2>

<p>I am a huge Arsenal supporter. I started loving the club because they wore a shade of red I liked when I was young and over the years when they had Arsene Wenger as coach, I got to like his approach and method of putting the club’s values first, before victories. After Wenger left, the club has been in a bit of a tailspin. Unai Emery who took over right after Wenger about 2 years ago failed to win the scoreboards and fans over which culminated in his sacking a few weeks ago. In his place, Mikel Arterta, a former captain was put at the the helm. While watching his first video as Arsenal coach the idea of this blog post came about. It was refreshing to hear how clear he was about what it takes for Arsenal to get back to greatness. One theme that I took away, was just about how serious he approached his work and the level he required of everyone who will contribute.</p>

<p>On belief:</p>

<blockquote>
  …I want to start working with them (the players), I want to start looking in their eyes…
</blockquote>

<p>On culture:</p>

<blockquote>
  …I know what a winning culture is and should look like, which is for me, the most imporant thing.
</blockquote>

<p>On method:</p>

<blockquote>
  I will not convince the players I have experience, I will convince them that I know certain things that if we do, will bring success and those are non-negotiables.
</blockquote>

<p>On being real:</p>

<blockquote>
  I want to be me , I do not want to be anyone else, it has to be natural, it has to come from inside and if that’s the case the player will trust me and i will be able to convince them what to do.
</blockquote>

<p>On culture, again:</p>

<blockquote>
  .. I think we have to create the right culture around the club where everyone respects each other, a humility and people have to be accountable for what we want to achieve. That’s the basics and then we can grow from there.
</blockquote>

<p>On being able to understand and create a bond with players:</p>

<blockquote>
  You are like a heart surgeon, I need to understand the feelings, I need to scrach there and understand how they feel. If i am able to do that and they feel that they can trust me, I will understand the decisions and behaviours much better and then the communication will improve.
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the full interview:</p>

<p>Now let’s come back to boxing where this concept of being serious has grave consequences (on health and performance), whilst being easy to judge.</p>

<p>I love boxing. Well, it’s one of the <em>many</em> sports I watch but my passion for it probably exceeds my passion for all other sports combined. As a result, I sift through a lot of tape of boxers practicing for big matches; I love the mental game and I feel warm inside when the hard grit and pushing of physical boundaries is rewarded at the end of a tense encounter. On the issues of seriousness though, let me take you through a couple of interesting fights that happened in 2019.</p>

<h3 id="jarrett-swift-vs-williams">Jarrett Swift Vs Williams</h3>

<p>A couple of months before this bout, Jarrett Swift was looking like a solid champion. He’s a guy that does get touched (hit) though, his defense is not the best but he was a champion who defended his belt a few times and went into the fight with Williams as the favourite. Williams on the other hand had lost dismally to Jermell Charlo by being brutally knocked out. Everything seemed to be pointing to a Hurd victory (he broke into song at one of the pre-fight press conferences). Willams, the underdog, physcially dominated and dropped Hurd on his way to a clear, unanimous victory. After the match, it became clear how much work Williams had put in to win that fight. This quote after the match says it all:</p>

<blockquote>
  “They told me I was done, that I had no chin,” Williams said. “Jarrett’s such a great fighter and he pushed me. I got so motivated because everybody was doubting me. I turned my Twitter off, I turned my Instagram off. I blocked out all the good stuff, I blocked out all the bad stuff. The boxing world, they make it seem like fighters take a loss and they can’t come back, and I just knew that wasn’t the case. Stop condemning fighters after they take a loss.”
</blockquote>

<h3 id="andy-ruiz-vs-joshua">Andy Ruiz Vs Joshua</h3>

<p>In June of 2019, there was a shock victory when the defending heavyweight champion got what seemed like a routine cherrypick against the buffy Andy Ruiz. Going into the fight, Joshua was being touted as the next big thing in boxing, he had defeated a couple of decent contenders before big crowds (90K+) in the UK where he comes from. When the time came to face a huge underdog after his mandatory challenger Jarrell Miller was busted for using PEDs, he thought it was going to be a normal night in the squared ring. What happened instead, was shocking. Andy Ruiz came into the fight without much of a period to psych up and train for Joshua (just 3 weeks as opposed to 8 or 12). After being dropped to the canvas in the 3rd round, Andy got back up on his feet and delivered a battering to Joshua that shocked the world. In the 7th round he became the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world.</p>

<h4 id="the-rematch">The rematch</h4>

<p>Given the result of the fight, and the contract for it having a rematch clause, Joshua decided to activate that right away to earn his titles back. Whilst Joshua worked hard to change his style to deal with this new threat, Andy Ruiz was getting used to being champion of the world and having extra cents in his pocket. He went on a splurge that included house purchases and cars, soaking up as much of the spotlight as he could. The day the rematch happened, Andy Ruiz was in horrible shape, overweight and had missed the first few weeks of training. In contrast, Joshua who had had the belts for a good period of his professional career came in lighter and looked more focused albeit with low confidence. He swiftly took his belts back without much physical resistance from Andy Ruiz.</p>

<p>Let’s pause for a moment and think about this: Andy Ruiz had the whole world at attention after a shock win, with the rematch looming one would think he would put in the hard graft to make the biggest statement and remain champion, right. How could it be he came in in worse shape than the former champion?</p>

<h3 id="tony-harrison-vs-jermall-charlo">Tony Harrison Vs Jermall Charlo</h3>

<p>In another surprising match, in the middleweight class, the champion Jermall Charlo defended his belt against the little known Tony Harrison. Whilst Jermall is not really known for being heavy-handed, he fought to get a knockout during the fight but round by round it proved elusive. Tony Harrison fought a clever fight of boxing and avoiding long exchanges, however it was just not enough to be convincing. After the fight went to the scorecards (because there was no knockout), Tony Harrison was declared the victor by all the judges. Many in the boxing community were not impressed which warranted a rematch.</p>

<h4 id="the-rematch-1">The rematch</h4>

<p>During the build up to the rematch Jermall, feeling hard done by the judges the first time, wore his emotions on his sleeve with Harrison as cool as a cucumber; he just didn’t take anything said by the former champion seriously. Jermall had a hard time dealing with such a calm head and became emotional. After the first bell rang, the fight did not disappoint with Jermall dropping Harrison early in the second round. After getting up however, Harrison boxed intelligently once again and won a good couple of rounds which gave his confidence a major boost as he seemed on his way to another unanimous win. He felt so in control that he started showboating during the middle rounds. On one of those occassions, in the 11th round, he was caught napping and knocked down out of nowhere! Upon getting up, he was hit with some solid shots again and had to cover up on the ropes which forced the referee to halt the contest.</p>

<p>After the match, a tearful Harrison knew what chance he had let slip. In his own words, he relaxed because he felt his was “coasting”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These few examples has prompted me to wonder what type of player I am on my team. If someone looks me / you, in the eye do they see the belief you are doing enough to guarantee victory? Have you dedicated yourself enough to your craft to be an A-player? How have you handled early success to guarantee you stay at the top of the game and keep the same hunger?</p>

<p>Some of these problems are very interesting too, they can only be learned by making mistakes…and some mistakes take success first to happen.</p>

<p>Any comments please drop them below, this is a conversation I would love to expand on in my future posts.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for reading!</p>

<h3 id="-leaving-awesome-onesheep-"><a href="/2019/07/20/leaving-awesome-onesheep/"> Leaving awesome OneSheep </a></h3>

<p>20 Jul 2019</p>

<p>This is a post that I didn’t foresee myself writing for the last 3 or 4 years. It is amazing how long but short that time has been. Every day was always so fresh and full of promise, all because of the wonderful folks I was working with. I remember it like yesterday when I got the offer to become a full time contractor at <a href="https://onesheep.org">OneSheep</a>. Having been a Drupal contractor 2 years prior, I jumped at the chance to work on some awesome (and very diverse projects) and what a whirlwind it’s been with so many great memories made!</p>

<h3 id="-ignore-changes-to-specific-git-files-"><a href="/2019/05/18/ignoring-files-from-git-commits/"> Ignore changes to specific git files </a></h3>

<p>18 May 2019</p>

<p>There are times when you are working on something that should not be committed even though it has changed. In this instance, it’s not wise to add the changed files to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maybe because the file(s) should always remain in the repo</li>
  <li>or suppose it’s a config file with your private key for a service you are using locally, not everyone on the team even uses it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the case, git has an easy way for this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git update-index</code>! Here is how it works:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git update-index <span class="nt">--assume-unchanged</span> <span class="o">[</span>path_to_file]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This simple rule will delist/hide all changes on that file in future commits. That means you are free to edit the file locally and the changes won’t be staged nor pushed upstream! Listing the file again is straightforward:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git update-index <span class="nt">--no-assume-unchanged</span> <span class="o">[</span>path_to_file]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whilst the commands are handy, they do not come with an easy way to untrack an entire folder, which is not-great. However, this can be easily done by a bash command that can list all files you want to “untrack” locally and transverse that list, updating each file’s entry in the git index.</p>

<p>Update-index is a command that does exactly what it describes, it tells git to update its index for the tracked file it is given. When we set that entry of the file in the index to <code class="highlighter-rouge">assume-unchanged</code> what that does is tell Git to simply ignore anything that happens to that file. This results in performance gains via unburdening Git from doing unnecessary indexing on files we no longer care about. However, keep in mind that should the file be changed upstream, when merging commits, Git will still ignore it locally so it does introduce an extra step to be aware of.</p>

<p>Lastly the commands are pretty long. An easy way I use to set them to something friendlier is by aliasing them in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitconfig</code> file as follows:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="o">]</span>
assume-unchanged <span class="o">=</span> update-index <span class="nt">--assume-unchanged</span>
assume-changed <span class="o">=</span> update-index <span class="nt">--no-assume-unchanged</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After this change, you can easily call: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git assume-unchanged [file]</code>!</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but nod my head the entire length of the blog post written by Jeremy Wagner on <a href="https://jeremy.codes/blog/make-it-boring/">make it boring</a>. It’s not often that I find someone literally following my train of thought so succinctly, albeit from their own unique angle. The principle behind the post is that boring things are the big stones to be put in first.</p>

<p>28 Jan 2019</p>

<p>When was the last time you thought about how you should be learning? Like many, I realized I went through formal education immersed in different kinds of learning methods but remained oblivious to reasons for using them. This has always bothered me because I enjoy learning, a lot and quickening the speed of it whilst reaping all the benefits, is the ultimate goal. With that motive in mind, I decided to enroll in the free course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning to learn</a> by Terrence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley on Coursera. This blog post will outline some of the insights I have found helpful.</p>

<h3 id="-2018-"><a href="/2019/01/13/2018/"> 2018 </a></h3>

<p>13 Jan 2019</p>

<p>As is custom, at the end or start of year I share my goals and progress as we close and open new chapters. I don’t think there’s an actual chapter closed or opened, it’s comforting to think about it that way but i think life is a continuos stream of … life events that ultimately define our entire existence, there is no break. None. Whatever it may look like, it is a continuation. It’s a mere formality then to state that the last year and all that took place had been a long time coming, whether we acknowledge it or not.</p>

<p>Comparing what my aims were at the end of 2017 and now, I cannot help but feel like I am no longer as open with some of my ideas, goals etc. The reasons behind that are not quite apparent to me, but going through last year’s post I even marvelled at how much I shared about my life and where I intended to go. I sure do hope to investigate my reasons for initially defaulting to scraping the surface with this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="-recent-takeaways-from-pairing-"><a href="/2017/08/06/further-takeways-from-pairing/"> Recent takeaways from pairing </a></h3>

<p>06 Aug 2017</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, my workmate paid a visit to Harare from his place in Cape Town for some pair programming, again (yay!). After having had a head start in coding a web app for a mobile application (built with Xamarin), the objective was to quickly knock it into shape and ship it out. I had chosen VueJS for the frontend (because it’s awesome), supported by an API in Laravel - to maintain consistency with the mobile app, we wanted everything to remain exactly the same. During the time of pairing, I learned even more lessons than the other times when I have paired with other programmers.</p>

<h3 id="-working-time-"><a href="/2017/04/04/working/"> Working time </a></h3>

<p>04 Apr 2017</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, actually since the start of the year, i’ve experienced the most turbulent of times in terms of my daily schedule. Really i wish I was Cerberus, or could teleport to Mars and have slightly longer days. I’ve been under massive, gargantuan pressure to code, exercise, plan, reply emails and continue being a human <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/if-you-want-to-get-rich-stop-being-a-fucking-joker">who’s not a joker</a>.</p>

<p>13 Feb 2017</p>

<p>I have been enjoying the book Effective Engineer by Edmond Lau. One of the great tricks of becoming more effective is to set workflows that make you do more, much faster. I have ended up setting a few scripts to automate a lot of bash commands such as ssh-ing, using git etcetera and in this short primer i’d love to show total newbies how to have your own executable scripts from any place on your system.</p>

<p>The first thing to note here is Mac OS has a few candidate files in your home folder that it indexes for commands to use in every bash window. On my system, I prefer to use ~/.bash_rc mainly because it is loaded up when a new instance of a terminal window is opened compared to ~/.bash_profile which is loaded up at login.</p>

<p>07 Jan 2017</p>

<p>I almost always set goals for the year. In 2016 I had a bunch of goals and I think it’s fair to say I achieved about 50% of them, which has me beaming! I came to the comforting conclusion about two years ago that I’m in a marathon and my prophetic powers being what they’re (non-existant), estimating time is tough but I sure as hell have an idea about my direction. With that out of the way, here’s how my 2016 turned out to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started working with the incredible folks at <a href="http://www.onesheep.org">Onesheep.org</a>. This is arguably the best bunch of people i’ve come across!</li>
  <li>I participated in the C4K Hackathon and our team came an impressive second. Yay</li>
</ul>

<p>06 Nov 2016</p>

<p>Recently I had to help with maintenance of a server that I didn’t configure myself that had maxed out its storage (the horror!). Anyway, it took me some time to figure out it was using the handy and useful <a href="http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/">rdiff-backup</a> package to create and store backups automatically. Rdiff-backup’s mission is succinctly put as <em>an idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup</em></p>

<p>As it turns out, rdiff-backup does come with a handy tool to configure it to delete backups that are x-days old e.g 4 weeks:</p>

<p>17 Oct 2016</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure to travel for some pair programming with a senior developer in our team who lives in Cape Town. This being our first meeting, I was really excited to finally meet the guy we all joke is a bot (internal joke). During my time in Strand (quiet city in Cape Town), I learnt some things I’d like to share here. These things became more apparent <strong>after</strong> our sessions and I think they should be considered huge benefits of pairing with someone more senior.</p>

<p>28 Sep 2014</p>

<p>In his famous Stanford commencement address, Steve Jobs said something about connecting the dots and how you can only do that after the fact. The first time I heard that, it didn’t shake my thinking; actually I dismissed it offhandedly without putting much thought into it. Not that I didn’t think it wasn’t true nor profound but like most things in life, hands-on experience is often more hard hitting than simple, verbal advice.</p>

<p>Lesson learnt: FIGHT YOUR FEARS! So yesterday I got home after a weekend at my sister’s only to realize I didn’t have the keys to the apartment. I HAD to get inside the flat though, I had a meeting scheduled for 12 noon. The only way was to get into the flat through a small little window, at the top there (see attached pic) Seemed like the most daring operation, lol growing up I hadn’t climbed houses like my peers would possibly confess they so often did.</p>

<p>My Linux installation crashed this morning which got me thinking so much about doing regular backups and making sure everything is secure. It’s been a weird week really, one of my mates got his website hacked too so I’ve had to think a lot on web security as well. I’m a Drupaler and he was running Joomla!, the CMS I dabbled in when I got started into web development. I hope to show you some of the cool things one can do to secure a Joomla! Site, with hacktivists on the prowl now more than ever (for better or worse) it helps to take measures against seeing the photo my friend woke up to find .</p>

<p>Consistency is one of the key things young and budding entrepreneurs are never told enough times is fundamental to long-term, enduring success. In a lot of success talk and teachings people tend to concentrate on qualities that CREATE success, such as a strong desire for something, networking, working hard or smarter, etcetera. Based on experience so far, I can confidently say there’s something very close to what’s sometimes called “Beginner’s luck”. The easy-going, free flow of positive events at the start. It’s quite endearing and a lot of aspirants, quite literally, lose it at this early stage. Why that free, easy flow is often classified as success possibly has a lot to do with small, achieavable goals people set at start.</p>

<p>23 Apr 2013</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to stop many of the habits I had taken up in the past two, three years. That meant a lot of coding, consuming <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">entreporn</a> and talking a lot about opportunities we should be exploiting. What triggered this was not that I was feeling burned out, unmotivated or discouraged but I decided to find out what it felt like to live in an inhibited world once again.</p>

<p>I have recently become an avid podcast collector over the past month or so and I’m clearly enjoying it. Long before downloading podcasts was even considered normal consumption of internet bandwidth, many of my mates were onto downloading a ton of them, daily. I remember just how odd that struck me and I couldn’t figure their line of thinking whether they thought the internet would be shut down one day and they’d regret missed opportunities or they were seriously putting them to good use. To this day, i’m more clueless than I was then, having downloaded a few now, I can tell you, consuming them is the hardest part.</p>

<p>16 Mar 2013</p>

<p>It’s a few days after the two week <a href="http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/creative-entrepreneurship/culture-shift/">Culture Shift</a> ideation and hackathon hosted by the British Council, <a href="http://www.jumpstart.co.zw/">Jumpstart</a> and <a href="http://www.culturecode.co.uk/">Culture Code (UK)</a> and for most of us, we are still basking in the afterglow. It was a wonderful event hosted to help local artists mingle with the techies and try to hack together some real solutions to their problems.</p>

<p>Any talk of perfection is often linked to <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/">minimalism</a>.</p>

<p>Growing up and learning about design, I was advised to know when something is both nice and useful when “when there is nothing more to remove”. That became the mark of near-perfection to me. As a result I have tried to abide by this rule when going about design and writing. This decision has come to haunt me on several occasions with comments centering on the work appearing “bland”, not exciting, very quiet and such. So maybe sometimes I personally have taken it too far? A big possibility given i’m not much of a designer but minimalism doesn’t just stop at design.</p>

<p>It’s a new year(!) and we all know what to expect, bigger things! 2011 was nothing but brilliant and I am 100% sure 2012 will be just as fruitful!</p>
