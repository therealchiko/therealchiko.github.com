    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Hi there! I'm Chiko Mukwenha, a product engineer and builder.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently building <a href="https://contentboo.st" target="_blank">contentboo.st</a>
      in public, documenting the journey with real numbers and honest reflections.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a digital nomad who specializes in different flavors of JavaScript
      (React, Vue.js, React Native), PHP (Laravel), Python, and Flutter.
      I have a huge, insatiable appetite for Git and general bash scripting.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is my personal space where I share about things I learn in programming,
      startups, and life. I believe in the craft of building software thoughtfully —
      boring fundamentals over flashy trends.
    </p>
