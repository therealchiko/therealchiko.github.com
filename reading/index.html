	On this page are books that I have read or intend to. From time to time after finishing each book, I write a short summary on the main blog. I love to read books that focus a bit on philosophy, tech, contemporary and ancient plays, business, motivation, non fiction...basically a bit of everything. (Weirdly, I find pleasure in reading about ideas contrary to some of my own beliefs. Go figure)
