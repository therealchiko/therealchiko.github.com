	On this page are books that I have read or intend to. From time to time after finishing each book, I write a short summary on the main blog. I love to read books that focus a bit on philosophy, tech, contemporary and ancient plays, business, motivation, non fiction...basically a bit of everything. (Weirdly, I find pleasure in reading about ideas contrary to some of my own beliefs. Go figure).
	<h4>December 2018</h4>
	Atomic Habits by James Clear.
	<h4>January 2019</h4>
	Currently reading: <strong>Ready Player One</strong>
	<h4>What I intend to read next:</h4>
	<ul>

		<li>A Mind for numbers</li>
	</ul>
	I welcome suggestions on what to read next. Please feel free to DM me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/therealchiko">@therealchiko</a> or write to <a href="mailto:hi@chikomukwenha.co">hi@chikomukwenha.co</a> with any books you have enjoyed that are worth considering.
