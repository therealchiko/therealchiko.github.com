Hi there!

My name is Chiko Mukwenha and i'm a freelance software developer. I'm a digital nomad and specialize in different flavours of Javascript (React, VueJS, React Native), PHP, Python, CodeIgniter, Laravel. I harbour a huge, insatiable appetite for Git and general bash scripting.

This is my personal blog where I share about things that I learn in programming, life and finding happiness. I welcome feedback and i'm usually ready for a chat so feel free to hit me
up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/therealchiko) if you have a great idea to share, comments or a project that needs my involvement.

Thanks for reading!
