The purpose of this page is to help you with the most basic answers to questions you may have about webmail and web 
hosting service I offer.

Firstly, you belong in either of two categories: local or international client. International client is any business
or individual not-based in Zimbabwe. 

## International Clients

If you are an international client, I advise you to write an email to hi@chikomukwenha.co
for quick and prompt assistance. It's easier to provide help in a way that is timezone agnostic.

## Local Clients

If you are a local client, it's very likely you are reading this to find out how to access your webmail. (just my assumption!)

To access your email, please follow these instructions:

1. Your webmail access is always available at: webmail.yourdomain.org
2. Depending on the addresses created, there should always be an info@yourdomain.org registered.
3. On your login page, ALWAYS enter your username in full: as opposed to entering info, enter "info@yourdomain.org"
4. Once you have entered your password, if you're logging in for the first time, you'll likely be prompted to pick one
email client to use as default. I recommend Roundcube but the choice remains yours.

If you face any challenges, please reach out to me anytime.
