### Knowing when to use AI is key.
I recently tweeted about turning off autocomplete in my editor, which felt like cutting off a safety net—but to my surprise, resulted in a productivity boost. Though that could imply AI was holding me back, that wasn't necessarily the full story. It produced a lot of output but quantity doesn’t mean quality as we all know. After AI would code stuff up, it took me cleaning up for everything to work which left less than confident that I had created an optimal solution. As someone who got into coding for the craft, it of course gave me sleepless nights. However with autocomplete gone, I was able to get back to my usual cadence with one major variation where AI proved invaluable: refactoring! In terms of making sure code is organized well, I’d encourage mid and junior devs to tap into AI’s magical powers of making sure code is well written and organized. One shouldn’t stop there but ask AI why it made all its decisions so that you understand why certain decisions are better than others. Allow yourself to push back if it doesn’t make sense because at the end of the day, you have a lot more context about environmental factors than the context you can give AI.

### Learned helplessness
During my foray into integrating AI, I remained fearful of falling out of love with coding - even though it seemed creating value. It was a paradox I didn’t foresee but it hit me in the face that whilst I could put finishing touches on something AI had made, who had made it? As my prompting became better resulting in less the keystrokes, I felt a sense of loss and helplessness. Usually when creating a solution, I am used to sketching ideas, researching on potential blindspots, edgecases, design patterns, which creates a feeling of ownership. With AI doing much of this for me, it perpetuated the idea I wasn’t as needed in this process and instead of giving me some intrinsic happiness - it instead made me feel like an observer. I eventually hit me that if not used carefully, one can learn to be helpless due to overreliance on AI.

### Closing Arguments
I’m not opposed to AI. Far from it—AI is an incredibly powerful tool that has undeniably transformed the way I approach coding and problem-solving. However, like any tool, it requires calm, thoughtful consideration in its use. It’s not about blindly trusting AI to do all the work, but actively collaborating with it.

By maintaining a balance—leveraging AI for what it excels at while staying engaged and critical where it falls short—we can harness its potential without losing the joy, ownership, and creativity that make coding so fulfilling.
