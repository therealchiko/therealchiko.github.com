![My workspace](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xMXpqXxAH4yIHSBS4CydpcM-4Ts9eY5md-ddtO1sn0U8D58fJqrO48abJ6GaU8c0t4Yq1kXwUyPtstKxpwRdsgJyTDJA5GIZRj48qPcOR2E_G4-cptriVMrVzpc2GFO60r3x4D6Kpxs=w2400)

My workspace is a constant work in progress. I believe designing a workspace is an exercise in setting the tone and values your work should impart. After catching myself guilty of not paying close enough attention, I have changed to become a lot more intentional. My decision process of picking equipment is pretty straightforward: I identify a weakness, deep dive into understanding about the potential fixes, then buy something with a money-back guarantee, and friendly return policy (It's a lesson learnt the hard way). My list is not a recommendation list, but a collection of things that work very well __for me__, YMMV. Here we go:

- **Smart Power Trolly Inverter** [Link](https://www.takealot.com/smart-power-trolley-1-5kva-1000w-pure-sine-inverter-ups-charger-/PLID41356450)
<br >
It's not a proper setup in Africa if it doesn't account for backup power, is it? Well, to counter the unpredictable loadshedding, I got an inverter that provides uninterrupted power until Eskom (main power supplier in South Africa) sorts its issues out. I fit in two [12V 100Ah Lithim Ion batteries](https://www.takealot.com/lifepo4-lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-100ah/PLID72176907) and given it produces 1000W pure sine wave output, it's able to power all my devices. It's a worthy investment and probably my favourite on this list. **Rating**:  4.5/5

- **Keychron K1 V4** [Link](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-key)
<br >
I have had this keyboard for about a year now and I _kinda_ love it. I got it with brown switches so it's pretty clicky, probably a bit too much for my liking but for my first mechanical keyboard it eased me into the "art" nice and gently! I still however think that I type faster on my Macbook Pro but I love the feedback this keyboard gives me. One challenge I encountered is where to place my palms so I paired it up with a palm rest and the combo works well enough. **Rating**:  3.5/5

- **Logitech Master MX 3 Mouse**
<br >
I love this mouse! It's an absolute beast and it's touted as one of the most productive mice one can have, I can testify to that. It's super sensitive, and very configurable (per application). Before getting this I used a Magic mouse from Apple and there's a big difference between the two, at least for me. **Rating**:  4/5

- **Asus Proart display 27 inch** [Link](https://www.asus.com/za/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/ProArt/ProArt-Display-PA278QV/) and 24 inch [Link](https://www.takealot.com/asus-proart-pa248qv-24-wuxga-professional-monitor/PLID71035195)
<br >
These displays are phenomenal! I got the 24 inch at the time when I was suffering from massive screen glare from a LG widescreen. At first I wasn't super excited about the downgrade from a 33" to a mere 24" but the resolution on these displays is amazing!! With the ability to tilt them too, I started off with the 24 inch set up vertically but over time I have them sitting side by side and it's a set up that works tremendously well. **Rating**:  4/5

- **TekDesk Standing Desk** [Link](https://www.deskstand.com/collections/featured-deskstands/products/tekdesk-electric-adjustable-height-standing-desk)
<br >
I don't think I can say a lot about this desk except for that it's pretty functional. One of the big advantages is the ability to work whilst standing, of course, which works when short of energy, it will keep you on your toes, quite literally. **Rating**:  3.5/5

- **Elgato Key Light** [Link](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)
<br >
I have mixed feelings about this light. Whilst it works like a light should, it's not very responsive from its app. After the initial struggles of connecting it via Wifi each time, its controls are easy to understand and it comes with a 2800-lumen output and a temperature range of up to 7000K which is fine. **Rating**:  3.5/5

- **Sony MX3**
<br >
Again, this is pretty functional. I can't say anymore than that, it's silently effective, so much that I haven't put on any other headphones and felt like i'm missing out massively. Being no audiophile, what I always need are headphones that allow me to focus in Starbucks and in random cafes I go to on Fridays for a change of scenery. These headphones excel at that and when travelling on a plane, they're in a league of their own. **Rating**:  4/5

- **Sony a6400** [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-a6400-Mirrorless-Camera/dp/B07MV3P7M8?th=1)
<br >
What a camera! I'm glad I got this beast for video calls and recordings. Not only is it strong and feels sturdy, but it the default 16-50mm lens it comes with are absolutely fantastic. I, of course, didn't know that when I purchased so I coupled it with the also incredible but limited [Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens](https://www.ormsdirect.co.za/sigma-30mm-f-1-4-dc-dn-contemporary-lens-sony-e). I say limited because of it has a fixed range, which is not always the best given the distance between where I place the camera and where I sit during calls. Away from the desk, it can't do no wrong in terms of potrait photos, the aperture really flatters the photographer. **Rating**:  4/5

- **Shure SM7B mic** [Link](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/microphones/sm7b)
<br >
This is a legendary mic. The best in the business, probably. The only sad thing about it is you don't get to hear yourself but from the feedback of people on calls, it's marvelous. I couldn't be happier in terms of mic choice and I hope to give it a solid run over the next couple of years. It's built like a tank as well so this is easily a great investment. **Rating**:  4.5/5

- **Shure MVi Digital Audio Interface** [Link](https://www.shure.com/en-MEA/products/accessories/mvi)
<br >
This is a logical choice that I had to make quickly after reading reviews that it can handle the SM7B nicely. Being a noob at sound, and with the SM7B not being a condenser mic, I felt it would work and it does. It's easy enough to use, but only takes one input which might come to bite me later should I decide to have an instrument to play but for the purpose of podcasting and getting audio to the computer, it's checked all boxes. **Rating**:  3.8/5

- **TS3-plus** [Link](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/)
<br >
To bring all the equipment together, the displays, network cables, and anything else I need to plug into my laptop really I use the very dependable TS3-plus. It's a mean beast and ensures I use just one cable from my laptop to it, the rest of the ports it provides in a very clean and hidden way. It does get hot after many hours of use but besides that, I like how it handles everything I throw at it. **Rating**:  4/5
