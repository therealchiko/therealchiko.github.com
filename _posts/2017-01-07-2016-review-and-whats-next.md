I almost always set goals for the year. In 2016 I had a bunch of goals and I think it's fair to say I achieved about 50% of them, which has me beaming! I came to the comforting conclusion about two years ago that I'm in a marathon and my prophetic powers being what they're (non-existant), estimating time is tough but I sure as hell have an idea about my direction. With that out of the way, here's how my 2016 turned out to be:

+ I started working with the incredible folks at [Onesheep.org](http://www.onesheep.org). This is arguably the best bunch of people i've come across!
+ I participated in the C4K Hackathon and our team came an impressive second. Yay
<!--more-->
+ My total gross income reached 60% of the total target for the year
+ I learned a lot, in terms of programming and growing my skillset. My goal here was to master PHP, Python and become a Javascript Ninja. I haven't yet reached the point of mastery, I traded C# for Python and along the way I did a lot of PHP and Javascript. I can't call a win in this category but i'd say I set a good foundation going forward.
+ My other small goal was to make $300 as passive income per month, I've ended up at $150 so clear win here.
+ I did a bit of travel, whilst Australia was my target holiday destination, I ended up spending time in the U.K, Cape Town and Malawi.
+ I had two very enlightening relationships which unfortunately ended because of differences after 4 months each. So for 2017, i'm on a clean slate! 
+ I took up photography as a hobby albeit not a serious one, something I need to work on for next year.

Watching Mark Zuckerberg's Jarvis project, it occurred to me that I should surely set some big, audacious goals. Whilst in the U.K at SheepCon, we took time to aim for some moonshots. It was at that point I realized I might have been playing it safe for a while. Sharing goals helps a lot when it comes to knowing your own scale and how far you can aim. As a result I came away inching for the year to end and put some new goals down.

In 2017, I've decided to focus on the following:

1. **I'm going to write 1 blog post every week of 2017!** 
This is a challenge i'm taking with [Zinyando](http://twitter.com/zinyando)
2. **Contribute 300 commits to open source software**
3. **Read 2 books every month**
4. **Become a strong Javascript React & Node developer**
5. **Master PHP, and C# to become a strong fullstack dev**
5. **I'm going to start going to the gym and working out at least twice every week**
6. **I've a REALLY huge goal to transition from software programmer to engineer**
My approach to this is to take online courses (MOOCS) from top universities on computer science and software engineering to fill gaps in my self-taught programming knowledge.
7. **Financially, in 2017 I'm looking to grow my gross income by a factor of 3.5**
8. **Relationship goal is to become a bit more stable and land a partner who shares and agrees with core beliefs**
9. **I want to increase passive income and revenue from hobbies and side projects to $400 per month.**

That's it for you, i'll be updating this blog with progress and what i'll be doing and working on.

Thanks for reading, got any comments, just post below.
