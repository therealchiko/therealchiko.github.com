# Do work with people you respect

One of my key lessons this year has been learning to create and work with a team. When building a team, one of my key metrics now is to select people based on their unique, even eccentric, perspectives. In relationships, respect is crucial for maintaining goodwill, especially when there’s substantial room for healthy conflict and risk-taking. Team members who share key philosophies—or even a quirky, forward-thinking vision—make collaboration easier, even in the absence of consensus. When you agree on the big picture, it’s easier to trust each other’s differing approaches to getting there, making every step of the journey an exercise in negotiation.

When shared beliefs and values begin to diverge, it’s worth considering your options with fresh eyes.
