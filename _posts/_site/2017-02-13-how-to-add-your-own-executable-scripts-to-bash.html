<p>I have been enjoying the book Effective Engineer by Edmond Lau. One of the great tricks of becoming more effective is to set workflows that make you do more, much faster. I have ended up setting a few scripts to automate a lot of bash commands such as ssh-ing, using git etcetera and in this short primer i’d love to show total newbies how to have your own executable scripts from any place on your system.</p>

<p>The first thing to note here is Mac OS has a few candidate files in your home folder that it indexes for commands to use in every bash window. On my system, I prefer to use ~/.bash_rc mainly because it is loaded up when a new instance of a terminal window is opened compared to ~/.bash_profile which is loaded up at login.

Without further ado, let’s create a small script that will shutdown the laptop when we type:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">c.restart</code></p>

<h3 id="1st-approach---using-an-alias">1st Approach - using an alias</h3>
<p>Easiest way to do this is to create an alias for the command you’d normally type in the terminal. Open up your ~/.bashrc and enter the following:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">alias </span>c.restart<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"sudo shutdown -r now"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Save the file and close. 
To have this command available in bash, in your terminal window enter:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can test if it’s working by typing <strong>c.restart</strong> after that you should be asked for password before your computer restarts. (Since this is just for demo purposes you can enter a wrong one three times if you don’t want to restart).</p>

<h3 id="2nd-approach---adding-an-executable-script-to-your-bin-directory">2nd Approach - adding an executable script to your bin directory</h3>

<p>What we are going to do here is add a private bin directory with all the scripts you’ll later write. This is a good practice because it separates some important defaults from your own personal scripts you’d want to access easily.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to add the ~/bin directory to your PATH variable. Open up .bash_profile and add the following line:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"~/bin:</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Simply what we have done is added your own personal bin directory to the PATH variable which is used to look for scripts to execute when you submit a command to do something in your terminal.</p>

<p>Let’s go ahead and create that directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir ~/bin
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now any script we create in this folder will be easily accessible by name from the terminal. Let’s go ahead and create our program, and call it just “c.restart”:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

sudo shutdown -r now

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After this, if you type: <strong>c.restart</strong> in your terminal it should ask for your password. If you enter it, your laptop should restart.</p>

<p>That’s an easy way to add your own scripts that can automate a lot in your workflow and improve your efficiency.</p>
