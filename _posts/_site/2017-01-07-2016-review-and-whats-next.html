<p>I almost always set goals for the year. In 2016 I had a bunch of goals and I think it’s fair to say I achieved about 50% of them, which has me beaming! I came to the comforting conclusion about two years ago that I’m in a marathon and my prophetic powers being what they’re (non-existant), estimating time is tough but I sure as hell have an idea about my direction. With that out of the way, here’s how my 2016 turned out to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started working with the incredible folks at <a href="http://www.onesheep.org">Onesheep.org</a>. This is arguably the best bunch of people i’ve come across!</li>
  <li>I participated in the C4K Hackathon and our team came an impressive second. Yay
<!--more--></li>
  <li>My total gross income reached 60% of the total target for the year</li>
  <li>I learned a lot, in terms of programming and growing my skillset. My goal here was to master PHP, Python and become a Javascript Ninja. I haven’t yet reached the point of mastery, I traded C# for Python and along the way I did a lot of PHP and Javascript. I can’t call a win in this category but i’d say I set a good foundation going forward.</li>
  <li>My other small goal was to make $300 as passive income per month, I’ve ended up at $150 so clear win here.</li>
  <li>I did a bit of travel, whilst Australia was my target holiday destination, I ended up spending time in the U.K, Cape Town and Malawi.</li>
  <li>I had two very enlightening relationships which unfortunately ended because of differences after 4 months each. So for 2017, i’m on a clean slate!</li>
  <li>I took up photography as a hobby albeit not a serious one, something I need to work on for next year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Watching Mark Zuckerberg’s Jarvis project, it occurred to me that I should surely set some big, audacious goals. Whilst in the U.K at SheepCon, we took time to aim for some moonshots. It was at that point I realized I might have been playing it safe for a while. Sharing goals helps a lot when it comes to knowing your own scale and how far you can/should aim. As a result I came away itching for the year to end and put some new goals down.</p>

<p>In 2017, I’ve decided to focus on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>I’m going to write 1 blog post every week of 2017!</strong> 
This is a challenge i’m taking with <a href="http://twitter.com/zinyando">Zinyando</a></li>
  <li><strong>Contribute 300 commits to open source software</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Read 2 books every month</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Become a strong Javascript React &amp; Node developer</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Master PHP, and C# to become a strong fullstack dev</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I’m going to start going to the gym and working out at least twice every week</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I’ve a REALLY huge goal to transition from software programmer to engineer</strong>
My approach to this is to take online courses (MOOCS) from top universities on computer science and software engineering to fill gaps in my self-taught programming knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>Financially, in 2017 I’m looking to grow my gross income by a factor of 3.5</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Relationship goal is to become a bit more stable and land a partner who shares and agrees with core beliefs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>I want to increase passive income and revenue from hobbies and side projects to $400 per month.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll be updating this blog with progress and what i’ll be working on through the year.</p>
