<p>Recently I had to help with maintenance of a server that I didn’t configure myself that had maxed out its storage (the horror!). Anyway, it took me some time to figure out it was using the handy and useful <a href="http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/">rdiff-backup</a> package to create and store backups automatically. Rdiff-backup’s mission is succinctly put as <em>an idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup</em></p>

<p>As it turns out, rdiff-backup does come with a handy tool to configure it to delete backups that are x-days old e.g 4 weeks:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">rdiff-backup --remove-older-than 4W target-dir</code></p>

<!--more-->

<p>Running that works like magic but I realized we could have an automated recipe to run a cron job right after each backup is saved. Let’s proceed and do that:</p>

<p>touch /etc/cron.daily/remove_old.sh (don’t forget to make it an executable)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
rdiff-backup --remove-older-than 4W target-dir
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we configure our cronjob to run after the time when rdiff-backup has run its backup:</p>

<p>crontab -e</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>00 5 * * *  /etc/cron.daily/remove_old.sh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And that’s it! We have a cron job that prunes our directory for space every day at 5am.</p>

<p>To test if your script runs, test cron jobs like so:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>run-parts /etc/cron.daily
</code></pre>
</div>
